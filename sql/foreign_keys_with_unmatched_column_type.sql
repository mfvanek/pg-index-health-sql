-- Finds foreign keys where the type of the constrained column does not match the type in the referenced table.
--
-- The column types in the referring and target relation must match.
-- For example, a column with the integer type should refer to a column with the integer type.
-- This eliminates unnecessary conversions at the DBMS level and in the application code,
-- and reduces the number of errors that may appear due to type inconsistencies in the future.
